## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned
This is one of the most challenging projects i have encountered in the frontend mentor catalog, As it help me tackle my weak javascript points
I challenged myself to do the javascript aspect of the project

some New things i learnt
- 
```javascript
billInput.addEventListener("input", billInputFun);

function billInputFun() {
  billValue = parseFloat(billInput.value);
  calculateTip();

}
```
You can creat a function and go to another line to declare it

- I also tried not to use jquery in this project and tried to focus on the part i dont really understand
which is the event listeners.


### Continued development
- Add dark mode.


### Useful resources
Css Tricks, Mdn Docs

- youTube: [codeAgam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etYv-pPfol4) : This youtube channel is the one that i found that provided the readable and straightforward solutioon to the javascript aspect of my project,
i had few problem following what he was doing as we didnt use the same naming convention in the project but i was able to follow along carefully.
